1. **Plugin Name:** Pixel Posts Shield
2. **Short Description:** A unique PHP-only WordPress utility. A pixel style posts plugin acting as a shield. Focused on simplicity and efficiency.
3. **Detailed Description:** Pixel Posts Shield is a lightweight, PHP-only WordPress plugin designed to apply a distinctive pixel-style visual overlay to your posts and pages. It provides a simple yet effective way to add a unique aesthetic to your content.

**Key Features:**
*   **Global Pixel Shield:** Easily enable or disable the pixel shield effect across all supported posts and pages via a central settings page (found under Settings > Pixel Shield).
*   **Customizable Shield Color:** Choose any hexadecimal color for your pixel shield effect from the plugin's settings.
*   **Per-Post/Page Override:** Granular control is available through a dedicated meta box on individual post and page edit screens. This allows you to override the global setting, enabling the shield for specific content even if it's globally disabled, or disabling it if it's globally active.
*   **Admin Column Status:** A 'Shield Status' column is added to the Posts and Pages list tables in your WordPress admin, providing a quick visual indicator of whether the pixel shield is active for each item.
*   **Subtle Frontend Effect:** When active, the plugin applies a semi-transparent, pixelated overlay to the main content area (`<article>`) of your posts and pages. This effect is designed to be subtle, enhancing the visual style without hindering user interaction.
*   **Efficiency Focused:** All CSS and JS (though primarily CSS in this case) are generated inline, eliminating extra file requests for optimal performance, adhering to its PHP-only philosophy.

Pixel Posts Shield aims for simplicity and efficiency, providing a unique visual flair with minimal impact on performance.
