== Description ==
Pixel Posts Shield is a lightweight, PHP-only WordPress utility designed to add a unique 'pixel shield' visual effect to your posts and pages. It provides a global setting to easily enable or disable this effect across your site, alongside an option to customize the shield's color using a simple hex color input.

For granular control, the plugin includes a meta box on individual post and page edit screens, allowing you to override the global setting for specific content. An intuitive custom column in the WordPress admin list tables for posts and pages also displays the current shield status at a glance, indicating whether the pixel shield is active for each item. By generating all its CSS inline, Pixel Posts Shield focuses on simplicity and efficiency, ensuring minimal impact on performance while delivering its distinctive visual style.
